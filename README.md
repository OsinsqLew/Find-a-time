# Find a Time for You and Your Friends  

## How It Works  
1. Create your profile and a group for your friends.  
2. Add your available time slots.  
3. Specify how long you need and the minimum number of participants.  
4. **Find a Time** will find a common time slot for you.  
5. Enjoy spending time together! 🎉  

## Technical Details  
- The application uses the **Streamlit** library to display the webpage.  
- Data is fetched from a **MySQL** database using **FastAPI**.  
- The connection between the database and the API is **encrypted with SSL certificates**.  
- For additional security, the database operates in a **Master-Slave setup**, where writes occur only on the **Master**, and reads are handled exclusively by the **Slave**.  
- *For educational purposes app gives an opportunity to check how SQL injection works.*
